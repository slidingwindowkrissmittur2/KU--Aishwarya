: How to find the angle between hour and minute hands of a clock at any given time?
Ans.: The user will input the hour and minute of the time and the method should give the angle between the hour hand and minute hand at that given time.

input: 9 30, output: The angle between hour hand and minute hand is 105 degrees
input: 13 30, output: The angle between hour hand and minute hand is 135 degrees
The logic is to find the difference in the angle of an hour and minute hand from the position of 12 O Clock when the angle between them is zero. Each hour on the clock represents an angle of 30 degrees (360 divided by 12). Similarly, each minute on the clock will represent an angle of 6 degrees (360 divided by 60) and the angle for an hour will increase as the minutes for that hour increases.

So, our code will be as follows:

internal static void FindAngleinTime(int hours, int mins)      
 {      
     double hourDegrees = (hours * 30) + (mins * 30.0 / 60);      
     double minuteDegrees = mins * 6;      
    
     double diff = Math.Abs(hourDegrees - minuteDegrees);      
    
     if (diff > 180)      
     {      
         diff = 360 - diff;      
     }      
    
     Console.WriteLine("The angle between hour hand and minute hand is {0} degrees", diff);      
 }
